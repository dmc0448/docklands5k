    <h2>Cancellation due to Covid-19</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        It is with huge regret that Crusaders AC has to announce that the Indeed
        Docklands 5k, originally scheduled for Tuesday 7 July, will not take
        place this year. Under the current government guidelines we recognise
        that it would just not be feasible to stage the race at this time and
        our greatest priority is the health and safety of all our potential
        participants. Even if the situation is relaxed towards the end of the
        year, we feel it would not be practical to try and stage the race where
        it would likely clash with a potentially crowded calendar, be it
        athletic, cultural or otherwise. So, regrettably, we have to cancel
        rather than postpone, but we do look forward to seeing everyone again
        next year, with a date yet to be worked out but likely to be in June or
        July, for what has become a runner's favourite event.

      <h4>Baggage Drop Off</h4>
      <p>
        Directions will be clearly signposted. You will be provided with a bag
        tag at drop-off. Please write on the tag your race number that you will
        be given at registration and attach it to your bag. Pens will be
        provided. Give the bag to the steward and it will be placed in number
        sequence so that it can be easily recovered after the race.
      </p>
      <p>
        For security purposes you will be required to show your race number in
        order to recover your bag. Please do not leave valuables in your bag.
        Whilst the race organisers will make every effort to ensure the
        safekeeping of your bag, no responsibility can be accepted for loss of
        personal effects.
      </p>
      <h4>Access to the Start line</h4>
      <p>
        The assembly area for the event will be on the City Quay between the
        Start line (located at the junction of Lime Street and City Quay) and
        the southern end of the Samuel Beckett Bridge (at the junction with
        Cardiff Lane and City Quay). Please ensure that you enter the start
        section corresponding to your expected finishing time. Your time zone
        location will be facilitated by the presence of pacing groups (20 mins,
        25 mins and 30 mins) and, in order to avoid impeding faster runners,
        please do not assemble in a zone that would be ahead of your likely
        finishing time. You are expected to assemble in this area at the latest
        20 minutes before the start of the race (i.e. 19:25). Please follow the
        instructions of stewards and pacers at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please pin your race number bib with the safety pins provided on the
        front of your singlet/shirt and do not interfere with the timing chip
        which is contained in the bib. It is up to you to provide emergency
        contact information and we suggest you provide this by writing the
        details on the back of your race number bib.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this is a chip-timed event, your individual time will be
        recorded only from when you cross the start line to when you cross the
        finishing line.
      </p>
      <h4>At the Finish</h4>
      <p>
        After you cross the finish line please keep moving and follow the
        instructions of the stewards who will direct you towards the water and
        refreshment pick-up on your way back to the baggage area. Water will be
        available at the finish line.
      </p>
      <h4>Prize-giving</h4>
      <p>
        This will follow as soon as possible after the lead competitors have
        crossed the finish line and will be held will be held at Capital Dock
        behind Sir John Rogersonâ€™s Quay after the finish line. Any prizes not
        collected on the evening will be mailed out to competitors.

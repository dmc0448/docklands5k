      The Course
    </a>
    <div class="answer course">
      <p>
        The race will be held on Tuesday, July 7th, starting at 7:45pm. The race
        starts on the South Docks at Lime Street which is very near to the
        Samuel Beckett Bridge - that's the one almost opposite the Convention
        Centre. From there you will head towards the City Centre all the way to
        the Matt Talbot Bridge which you will cross over to the North Quay. From
        there you will run all the way down to the 3 Arena where you will loop
        back down the North Quay again towards the Matt Talbot Bridge. There you
        will cross the Bridge again and back to the South Quay. From there you
        will run back past the start line. The finish line is approx. 500 metres
        beyond the start line and you will finish at Sir John Rogerson's Quay.

    <a @click="toggleAnswer('money')" class="question">
      AND WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?
    </a>
    <div class="answer money">
      <h5>The Short Answer</h5>
      <p>
        We, Crusaders Athletic Club, are investing ALL the proceeds from the
        race into providing much needed sporting facilities to serve the
        Docklands Community in our HQ at Irishtown Stadium. So, money from the
        community will be invested back into the community.
      </p>
      <h5>The Slightly Longer Answer</h5>
      <p>
        The Docklands area is a vibrant and growing area. Indeed the Docklands
        has been designated as a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) which
        envisages a large rise of some 25,000 people in both the working and
        residential population in the Docklands during the next few years as
        more and companies set up in the area. This will give rise to a
        requirement for more residential living space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recreation plays a very important role in our lives. All work and no
        play, Jack!!! The Docklands area boasts a magnificent sport arena in
        Irishtown Stadium. There is not only a full 8 lane athletics track but
        also a fully equipped gym, all-weather 11-a side (which is also used for
        Tag Rugby), all-weather 5 a side pitches along with shower and changing
        room facilities all available and open to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crusaders Athletic Club (founded 1942) invested heavily in the
        construction of Irishtown Stadium in the early 2000's with the remainder
        being financed by Dublin City Council (DCC). Crusaders, as a result of
        this investment, are the anchor tenant in the stadium which is managed
        by DCC and open to all. The offering of the facilities in Irishtown
        Stadium to both residents and local companies' employees has seen our
        membership grow to 650 members (250 children and 400 adults) since 2015.
        We thus provide a crucial role in the Docklands community providing a
        healthy and worthwhile recreational activity to all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crusaders Athletic Club will use all the proceeds from the event to
        further enhance the sport facilities in the stadium to cater for the
        growing demand which will be placed upon the facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        So money from the Community raised through the Docklands 5k is invested
        back into the Community!! We hope you agree that this is a very
        worthwhile cause and one where you and many others will directly
        benefit.
